# Fashion Guru

This is a very simple React app that displays a shop front using items from an
API.

## What does the app do?

The app retrieves countries from a RESTful Fake eCommerce store API and displays
the shop items on the page.

## Contributors

This repo was created as part of a Hackathon Friday, where the aim was to create
an app in five hours, including design and presentation. There were four team
members - Troy, Scott, Julija and Sinead .

# Some Help Notes

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cwissy/examples_front-end-project-week)

## For Deploying

Make sure to set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` to be the url of your api. You can find
the guide in
[this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8q034OBs1GMuMSMYuUYrpAEg37zh8qBMCOBcJoQamk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.
